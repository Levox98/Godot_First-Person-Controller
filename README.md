# "Immersive" First Person Controller v1.0
A first-person controller designed for "immersive sim"-like control. The behaviour is done through a finite state machine. I just wanted to learn the pattern and make something useful at the same time. Feel free to contribute or submit issues :)

## How to use
Player.tscn contains the player character scene. Copy it to whichever scene, where you need it. Climbing works with any surface, no special setup necessary.

### Controls
- WASD = move
- Shift = hold to sprint
- C = crouch or to slide (when sprinting)
- Space = jump, hold near ledge while falling to grab

## Features
### Existing features
- Basic movement (i.e. walking, running, jumping)
- Crouching
- Sliding
- Climbing

### Planned features
- More customization (view bobbing, custom crosshair, etc.)
- Controller support
- Customizable animations for climbing
